 ### Merging Changes with Master[m
[31m-Now that you have made and committed your changes, it is time to merge your branch with master. Even though you are not working with anyone else on this repository, it is always good practice to make sure your current branch is completely up to date with master. Imagine if you were working with a team. Someone else has already pushed up changes to master. If that someone else and yourself have changed the same file, it is quite likely that your changes will not be compatible with theirs. To avoid this, you want to merge your changes with theirs to avoid future problems. Checkout back onto master and pull down. These commands look like this:[m

 Many development teams take it one step further and turn their commit messages into change logs. These change logs may be used for user consumption making it all the more important to have clear messages of what was done for that commit.[m

[31m-### Merging Commits[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Often you will find yourself wanting to merge commits, or organising your early commits slightly differently on a branch to better demonstrate what you worked on. I will briefly go through one easy way to do this.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-#### Reset Soft[m
[31m-This is my preferred method of merging commits together. It leaves you with lots of flexibility.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To begin, make a new branch and make some new files and commit regularly (at least twice).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Next `git log` and pick the 3rd most recent hash. Copy it and:[m
[31m-[m

[31m-git reset --soft <commit hash>[m
[31m-git status[m
[31m-git log[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Your working directory shouldn't changes, but all the files that you changed should be in green. Your log should have the newest commit as the hash you copied. Even though all your work is still the same as before the reset, the commits are different. Then you can commit again and this is an easy way to replace 2 or more commits with one commit.[m
